## Scenario
The class will organise itself into teams of seven (possibly six) students - these teams are in "commercial competition" and should not discuss their work with other teams. The teams are bidding for a commercial contract to be awarded by "Southampton ECS Enterprise Developments" (SEED), a recent start-up company with ambitious plans for a new product. The precise details of the product are a closely-guarded secret at present, because SEED is concerned that a competitor might launch a competing product.

SEED is aware that it will need to hire a development team with expertise in Python and Javascript to develop their proposed product and wishes to assess the competence of the available teams before awarding the contract. SEED requires each team to provide a "Scripting Demo Prototype" to demonstrate their expertise with these scripting languages and will award the contract to the team that demonstrates the highest level of expertise. It is mandatory that these two defined scripting languages must be used in this demonstration prototype:
- server-side Python
- client-side Javascript

The exact form of the prototype is left open to the competing teams, except that the client application must execute inside ECS and the server-side Python must execute outside ECS on the Google App Engine (N.B. the use of Java is explicitly prohibited).
